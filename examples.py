("Tharun", "Hey everyone, welcome back. Today we're going to do a deep dive into, uh, three financial stories. Okay. The real, at first glance, you might think are totally unrelated."),
("Monica", "Okay."),
("Tharun", "But as we get into it, I think you're going to see some really interesting connections. Right. Um, and, uh, should be pretty fascinating."),
("Monica", "Okay. Sounds good."),
("Tharun", "We've got a report from Goldman Sachs on India's outlook for 2025. Mm hmm. We got BlackRock talking about these mega forces shaping global markets. Right. Right. And then the EIA, the U. S. Energy Information Administration, giving us their predictions on oil prices. Wow.  Quite a mix."),
("Monica", "Yeah. It is."),
("Tharun", "Um, but I think it's all going to tie together quite nicely."),
("Monica", "Um, but I think it's all going to tie together quite nicely."),
("Tharun", "I'm intrigued."),
("Monica", "Okay."),
("Tharun", "So let's start with that Goldman Sachs report on India. Mm hmm."),
("Monica", "hmm."),
("Tharun", "Um, they're projecting GDP growth of 6. 3 percent for 2025."),
("Monica", "Okay."),
("Tharun", "Um, and I know you've been, you've been following the global economics scene really closely. Yeah."),
("Monica", "Yeah."),
("Tharun", "Yeah. Yeah. What's your take on that number? Is that good, bad, just kind of meh?"),
("Monica", "Well, you know, it's interesting because while 6. 3 percent might not sound super impressive, it actually reflects a global shift, I think, towards more, I guess, caution and resilience. Okay. Um, you know, we're, we're in this time where there's a lot of uncertainty in economies around the world."),
("Monica", "So a steady, predictable growth rate might actually be a really smart strategy for India."),
("Monica", "Right. It's like choosing to build like a solid foundation rather than going for this  risky sky, skyscraper that might just topple over."),
("Tharun", "Yeah, exactly. It's about kind of long term stability."),
("Monica", "Right. Exactly."),
("Monica", "And the Goldman Sachs report, it actually points to a few factors that contribute to this kind of measured growth."),
("Tharun", "Okay."),
("Monica", "You know, slower government spending on infrastructure, which I think makes sense given the global environment."),
("Tharun", "Yeah."),
("Monica", "Tighter credit lending, especially for those unsecured loans like credit cards."),
("Tharun", "Right."),
("Monica", "And inflation hovering around 4. 2%. Right. Right. Right. Right."),
("Tharun", "Yeah, inflation. The word that always seems to be on everyone's mind these days."),
("Monica", "Yeah, it's a big one."),
("Monica", "And they even mention, I think, in the report, those, like, vegetable price shocks."),
("Tharun", "Oh, right. Like what happened with tomatoes earlier this year."),
("Monica", "Exactly, yeah. You know, those sudden spikes can really impact people's budgets."),
("Tharun", "Yeah, no kidding. It can make a big difference."),
("Monica", "But overall, it seems like India is taking this kind of, you know, singles and doubles approach, you know, like a seasoned cricketer playing a long match."),
("Tharun", "Okay. It's about staying in the game."),
("Monica", "Right, playing the long game."),
("Tharun", "Exactly."),
("Monica", "Okay, so, but what about the stock market? How does all of this, like, cautious approach translate into the Indian stock market outlook?"),
("Tharun", "Yeah, that's a great question. So, Goldman Sachs predicts that the Nifty Index, that's India's biggest index Benchmark stock market index will reach 27, 000 by the end of 2025."),
("Monica", "Okay, so again, not explosive growth, but you know, steady progress, right? And this is likely due to high valuations and the fact that earnings growth has been a bit  sluggish lately."),
("Tharun", "So it's not like. Get rich quick schemes."),
("Monica", "No, not really."),
("Tharun", "It's more like, you know, some solid long term investment opportunities, potentially."),
("Monica", "Exactly, and for those who like to dig a little deeper, Goldman Sachs, they suggest keeping an eye on sectors like autos, real estate, and e commerce."),
("Tharun", "Okay."),
("Monica", "They see some potential for some unexpected growth there."),
("Tharun", "Interesting. All right, now let's shift gears to BlackRock and their 2025 global. market outlook."),
("Tharun", "They're talking about these mega forces that are going to shape the investment landscape. It sounds pretty dramatic when you say it like that."),
("Monica", "It does. Right. But what they're really getting at is these major global trends, okay? With the potential to really disrupt, you know, the status quo. And they've identified three artificial intelligence, Global protectionism and then economic fragmentation."),
("Tharun", "Okay. And what's interesting is how these forces, they're all kind of intertwined, almost like a three headed dragon, you know?"),
("Monica", "Okay, that's a visual."),
("Tharun", "Right. I wasn't expecting that."),
("Monica", "But, you know, these three forces are shaping things."),
("Tharun", "Yeah, got it. Okay, so let's tackle this dragon one head at a time. Um, and starting with AI, Blackrock seems  particularly bullish on this one."),
("Tharun", "They're calling it like the start of a new industrial revolution. Is that hyperbole or is there something to that?"),
("Monica", "I don't think it's hyperbole. You know, they're predicting a staggering 700 billion will be spent on AI infrastructure by 2030. And they believe that U. S. companies will be leading this charge."),
("Monica", "But I'm curious, what are your thoughts on India's Potential role in this, in this whole AI revolution."),
("Tharun", "Well, I mean, India's got a rapidly growing tech sector. The government is investing heavily in AI initiatives. I mean,  Could India become a major player in this, even alongside the U. S. Giants?"),
("Monica", "I think it's definitely possible."),
("Monica", "You know, India has this huge advantage with its young tech savvy population."),
("Tharun", "Right."),
("Monica", "And a growing pool of talented engineers and developers."),
("Tharun", "Yeah, for sure."),
("Monica", "It's definitely a space to watch."),
("Tharun", "Okay, so that's, I mean, that's really interesting for me because it's not just like an abstract trend. It's like, how does this actually translate into real world opportunities?"),
("Monica", "Absolutely, yeah."),
("Tharun", "Okay, let's move on to the other two heads of BlackRock's dragon."),
("Monica", "Okay."),
("Tharun", "Global protectionism and economic fragmentation."),
("Tharun", "What's the gist of this and should we be worried?"),
("Monica", "Yeah, so essentially what it means is that countries are becoming more cautious about global trade."),
("Tharun", "Okay. Um,"),
("Monica", "and they're increasingly focusing on protecting their own industries."),
("Tharun", "So we're moving away from that, like, hyper globalized world."),
("Monica", "Yeah, I think so. I think we're seeing a shift away from that. Supply chains are being reorganized, new trade alliances are forming, and geopolitics is playing a bigger role."),
("Tharun", "So it's less free trade and more every country for itself."),
("Monica", "Sure."),
("Tharun", "How does this impact India?"),
("Tharun", "Yeah. Especially with our, like, growing role in global supply chains."),
("Monica", "Yeah, that's a key question. And while this shift does present challenges, it could also create unique opportunities for India. Okay. You know, as companies look to diversify their sourcing and manufacturing, India, with its large workforce and competitive costs, could become an even more attractive destination."),
("Tharun", "So it's kind of turning a potential threat into a strategic advantage, almost."),
("Monica", "Exactly, yeah."),
("Tharun", "So it's not all, like, doom and gloom. It's more like Adapting to a changing landscape, right?"),
("Monica", "Yeah. And BlackRock also raises this important point about how these mega forces are challenging traditional investment strategies."),
("Monica", "They're actually questioning the wisdom of that classic 60 40 portfolio split between stocks and bonds."),
("Tharun", "Wait, is that old rule of thumb like going out the window? I always thought it was like the gold standard."),
("Monica", "Well, it might need some tweaking. For this new world, you know, Blackrock argues that in this environment of rapid technological advancements and all these geopolitical shifts, investors need to be more dynamic and theme focused."),
("Tharun", "So less about just like passively investing in broad asset classes. Right. More about like. Actively choosing investments based on these, like, emerging trends."),
("Monica", "Precisely. It's about aligning your investments with the forces that are shaping the future, like AI, for example."),
("Tharun", "Okay. Food for thought for those of us who are not, like, professional investors, but trying to manage our own portfolios."),
("Tharun", "All right.  Let's, let's wrap up this, uh, this part of our deep dive with our final story.  Oil prices. We know that NDA imports a significant amount of its oil. Right. So what happens globally has a big impact on us. What's the EIA's forecast for 2025?"),
("Monica", "So they're predicting that Brent crude oil, that's the international benchmark for oil prices, will average around 74 a barrel in 2025."),
("Tharun", "Now, I know you're probably thinking, with all the global tensions and conflicts."),
("Tharun", "Honestly, yeah. I was expecting some wild swings at a much higher number. What's keeping prices relatively stable?"),
("Monica", "It's a combination of things. We're seeing increased oil production from non OPEC countries like the U. S.,"),
("Monica", "Canada, Guyana."),
("Tharun", "That increased supply is helping to offset some of the geopolitical risks."),
("Monica", "So it's like having more players in the game."),
("Tharun", "Right."),
("Monica", "Which reduces the influence of any single player."),
("Tharun", "Exactly. Plus, the OPEC, plus countries, those big oil producers in the Middle East, are maintaining tighter control over their production levels."),
("Monica", "They're being strategic about how much oil they're pumping out, which is also contributing to price stability."),
("Tharun", "That makes sense. It's like they're walking a tightrope trying to balance their own economic interests with global demand. But speaking of demand, what's the picture looking like? I know India and China are major consumers of oil."),
("Tharun", "So what role are they playing in this equation?"),
("Monica", "You know, the EIA predicts that India will add 300, 000 barrels per day of demand in 2025. Driven by our expanding transportation and infrastructure sectors. We're talking about more cars on the road, more planes in the air, more construction projects."),
("Tharun", "So as India's economy grows, so does its thirst for oil."),
("Monica", "Right."),
("Tharun", "Makes sense."),
("Monica", "Right."),
("Tharun", "But what about China? Aren't they also a major factor in global oil demand?"),
("Monica", "They are. But there's an interesting twist. The EIA report highlights that a significant amount of Canadian oil that was originally expected to be shipped to China is now heading to refineries on the U. S. west coast. This could indicate that Chinese demand might not be as strong as initially anticipated."),
("Tharun", "Wow, that's a pretty significant shift. What are the implications of that, both for the global oil market and for India?"),
("Monica", "Well, for the global market, it suggests that we might see a bit more price stability than previously thought."),
("Monica", "If Chinese demand is indeed softening, that could help offset some of the upward pressure on prices."),
("Tharun", "And for India?"),
("Monica", "For India, it's potentially good news. Lower oil prices mean lower costs for consumers and businesses, which could help keep inflation in check. It also eases the pressure on our trade deficit, and frees up government funds that can be used for other priorities like investing in infrastructure or social programs."),
("Monica", "So while we can't completely ignore the potential for geopolitical shocks, the overall picture for oil prices seems relatively stable, at least for now."),
("Tharun", "That's right. But as we've seen, the world can change quickly. It's always a good idea to stay informed and be prepared for potential volatility."),
("Tharun", "Okay, so we've covered a lot of ground here."),
("Tharun", "We've explored India's economic outlook, BlackRock's mega forces shaping global markets, and the EIA's predictions for oil prices. It's clear that these stories are interconnected, even though they might seem unrelated at first glance. But before we go any further, let's zoom in a bit. And focus on what this all means for our listeners here in India."),
("Monica", "That's a great point. Let's break it down starting with the economic outlook. India's steady, measured growth. While perhaps not as dazzling as some might hope actually provides a stable foundation for individuals and businesses alike."),
("Tharun", "It's like building a house on solid ground."),
("Monica", "Yes."),
("Tharun", "Instead of on shifting sand."),
("Monica", "Exactly. In a world that feels increasingly unpredictable, that sense of stability is incredibly valuable. It allows for more reliable planning and fosters a sense of confidence, which is crucial for both investors and consumers."),
("Tharun", "Now, what about those specific sectors that Goldman Sachs highlighted, auto's real estate and e commerce?"),
("Tharun", "What are the implications for the average person in India? Should we be rushing out to buy a new car or invest in property?"),
("Monica", "Well, I wouldn't say rushing out, but these sectors definitely present interesting opportunities. Take the auto sector, for example. With India's growing middle class and increasing urbanization, the demand for personal vehicles is only going to rise."),
("Monica", "This translates into potential job opportunities in manufacturing sales, service sectors, related to the auto industry."),
("Tharun", "So if you're looking for a career change or just starting out, the auto sector might be worth exploring. What about real estate? I know a lot of people in India see property as a safe investment."),
("Tharun", "So what's the outlook there?"),
("Monica", "Well, Goldman Sachs doesn't predict explosive growth, but they do hint at potential surprises. With India's ongoing urbanization, the demand for housing will likely remain strong, particularly in high growth urban centers."),
("Tharun", "So location is key, as always. What about e commerce? It seems like everyone is shopping online these days, so I imagine this sector is booming in India too."),
("Monica", "Absolutely. With our rapidly expanding digital infrastructure and a young, tech savvy population, e commerce in India is poised for even further growth. This means more choices and convenience for consumers, but it also translates into a wealth of job opportunities in areas like logistics, digital marketing, and customer service."),
("Monica", "So whether you're an entrepreneur looking to launch a new venture, or someone seeking a job in a fast growing field, the e commerce space offers a lot of potential."),
("Tharun", "Yeah."),
("Tharun", "Now let's bring back BlackRock's mega forces and connect them to India.  AI seems to be the game changer here, but it also raises some big questions."),
("Monica", "It does. While India has the potential to become a major player in the AI revolution, we need to ensure that the benefits are shared equitably. We need to be proactive in addressing potential challenges like job displacement and the digital divide, making sure everyone has access to the skills and training needed to thrive in this new world."),
("Tharun", "It's like we're standing at a crossroads. Yeah. We can either harness the power of AI for the benefit of everyone. Right. Or we can allow it to exacerbate existing inequalities. It's a critical moment for India.  Now what about the other mega forces? Global protectionism and economic fragmentation. How are these trends likely to impact us here in India?"),
("Monica", "Well, as we discussed, these trends represent a move away from the hyper globalized world we've become accustomed to. Countries are becoming more cautious about global trade and are increasingly focused on protecting their own industries."),
("Tharun", "So less free trade and more every country for itself."),
("Monica", "In a way, yes."),
("Monica", "But while this shift presents challenges, it also offers unique opportunities for India. As global supply chains are being reconfigured, companies are seeking alternative manufacturing hubs that are reliable and cost effective."),
("Tharun", "And India fits that bill."),
("Monica", "Precisely. With its large workforce growing infrastructure and government initiatives aimed at boosting manufacturing, India is well positioned to attract those companies seeking to diversify their operations."),
("Monica", "So this trend towards regionalization could actually work in our favor. It's about adapting and capitalizing on the changing dynamics of global trade.  But I imagine there will be challenges too, right?  What are some of the hurdles India might face as we navigate this new landscape?"),
("Monica", "One of the biggest challenges will be ensuring that our workforce has the skills and training needed to meet the demands of these new, more localized supply chains."),
("Monica", "We need to invest in education and training programs that equip our people with the skills required for the jobs of the future."),
("Tharun", "So it's not just about attracting companies."),
("Monica", "Right. It's about having a workforce that's ready to step into those roles."),
("Monica", "Exactly. We also need to continue improving our infrastructure, particularly our transportation and logistics networks, to ensure that we can efficiently move goods and services within the country and across borders."),
("Monica", "And of course, maintaining a stable and predictable regulatory environment will be crucial to attracting and retaining foreign investment."),
("Tharun", "It sounds like India has a lot of work to do, but also a lot of potential to benefit from these shifting global dynamics."),
("Monica", "Absolutely. It's a time of both challenges and opportunities, and how well India adapts will determine its future success."),
("Tharun", "Okay, so we've talked about how these mega forces are reshaping the global economic landscape and what that means for India. But let's shift gears now and talk about something that directly impacts everyone's wallet,  oil prices. We already discussed the EIA's forecast for relatively stable oil prices in the coming years, but what does that actually mean for people on the ground here in India?"),
("Monica", "Well, first and foremost, stable oil prices help keep inflation under control. This is crucial for maintaining a healthy economy and ensuring that people's purchasing power isn't eroded by rising prices."),
("Tharun", "So when we fill up our cars, or pay our electricity bills, we're less likely to experience those painful price hikes."),
("Monica", "Exactly. Stable oil prices also reduce the pressure on India's trade deficit. Remember, we import a significant portion of our oil, so lower oil prices mean we're spending less on imports."),
("Tharun", "That's good news for the overall health of the Indian economy."),
("Monica", "It is. And finally, lower oil prices free up government resources that can be directed towards other priorities, like infrastructure development, education, health care, or social welfare programs."),
("Monica", "So it's a win win situation for everyone. Consumers, businesses, everyone."),
("Tharun", "In many ways, yes. But as we discussed earlier, the Middle East remains a volatile region, and any unexpected geopolitical events could disrupt the oil market and send prices soaring."),
("Monica", "So while we can breathe a sigh of relief for now, we can't become complacent."),
("Monica", "We need to stay informed and be prepared for potential volatility."),
("Tharun", "Absolutely. It's all about understanding the interconnectedness of global events and how they can impact our lives even in seemingly unexpected ways."),
("Tharun", "Now, before we wrap up this part of our deep dive, let's circle back to BlackRock's suggestion about rethinking our investment strategies in this new world of AI, global protectionism and economic fragmentation."),
("Tharun", "What are some practical takeaways for our listeners who are wondering how to apply this to their own portfolios?"),
("Monica", "That's a great question. It's something we could spend a whole episode discussing, but let me offer a few key points to consider. First and foremost, it's essential to move beyond that traditional mindset of simply allocating a fixed percentage to stocks and bonds."),
("Tharun", "You mean that old 60 40 rule of thumb might not be the best approach anymore?"),
("Monica", "It might need some adjustments. In this new world, it's crucial to be more dynamic and strategic in your investment approach. Instead of focusing solely on broad asset classes, consider investing in specific themes and trends that are likely to drive future growth."),
("Tharun", "So think about those megaforces we discussed. AI, global protectionism, economic fragmentation.  They're creating both opportunities and risks."),
("Monica", "Precisely. Identify sectors and companies that are well positioned to benefit from these trends.  For example, if you're bullish on AI, consider investing in companies developing cutting edge AI technologies or those leveraging AI to transform their industries."),
("Monica", "And if you're concerned about global protectionism, maybe look for companies that are diversifying their supply chains or focusing on domestic markets."),
("Tharun", "Exactly. It's about aligning your investments with the changing global landscape. And don't be afraid to be a bit more active in managing your portfolio."),
("Tharun", "So don't just set it and forget it. Stay informed about what's happening in the world, and be prepared to adjust your investments as needed."),
("Monica", "Exactly. And finally, remember that investing is a long term game. Don't get caught up in short term market fluctuations. Stay focused on your goals and invest in"),
("Tharun", "That's great advice."),
("Tharun", "So it's not about panicking or making rash decisions based on headlines. It's about being strategic, staying informed, and thinking long term."),
("Monica", "Precisely. It's about taking control of your financial future and making informed choices that align with your personal circumstances and investment goals."),
("Tharun", "Well said."),
("Tharun", "And with that, I think we'll wrap up part two of our deep dive. Okay, so welcome back to part three of our deep dive. We've covered a lot of ground in this deep dive, from India's economic outlook to the rise of AI, a shifting global landscape, and even oil prices."),
("Monica", "We certainly have, and it's really amazing to see how all these Seemingly separate things are actually like woven together."),
("Monica", "It creates this very complex tapestry of, you know, global trends and events."),
("Tharun", "Exactly. And I think one of the key takeaways for me is this whole idea of interconnectedness. What happens in one part of the world. You know, it can have ripple effects that reach far beyond its borders."),
("Monica", "Absolutely. Whether it's technological advancements or economic policies, geopolitical tensions."),
("Monica", "These forces, they don't operate in isolation. They influence and shape each other, sometimes in ways that are predictable and sometimes in ways that are pretty surprising."),
("Tharun", "Right. And that brings me to a question that I've been thinking about. You know, we've talked about how India is positioned to kind of navigate these changing global landscapes."),
("Tharun", "Yeah. But what about just the individual? What about their role in all of this? Mm hmm. It's easy to feel, like, overwhelmed by these mega forces. Like, we're just these tiny boats, you know, being tossed about by this vast, like, unpredictable ocean."),
("Monica", "I understand that feeling. I think it's natural to feel a little bit powerless when you're faced with that."),
("Monica", "global events that seem totally outside your control.  But I really do believe that individuals have more agency than they might realize."),
("Tharun", "So it's not just about being swept along with the current."),
("Monica", "Not at all. I think it's about recognizing that even our individual choices and actions, no matter how small they might seem, they can collectively make a difference."),
("Tharun", "Can you give me an example?"),
("Monica", "Sure. Think about the investment strategies that we talked about earlier. You know, by choosing to invest in companies that align with our values that are working to, let's say, address global challenges like climate change or social inequity, we're not just seeking financial returns."),
("Monica", "We're also kind of using our capital to actually drive positive change."),
("Tharun", "So it's about being conscious consumers and investors, understanding that like our choices have consequences. That, like, extend beyond just our immediate needs."),
("Monica", "Exactly. And it's not just about money. It's about being informed citizens, engaging in thoughtful discussions, and advocating for policies that really promote, you know, sustainability, equity, and progress."),
("Monica", "It's about, you know, recognizing that we're all a part of this larger system."),
("Tharun", "Right."),
("Monica", "And our actions, both individually and collectively, have this power to actually shape that system. for better or for worse."),
("Tharun", "Absolutely. It's about shifting our mindset from, you know, just being a passive observer to being an active participant from feeling overwhelmed to actually feeling empowered."),
("Tharun", "That's a powerful message. I think that's a great place to kind of wrap things up. So I want to encourage our listeners to just keep exploring these topics. Stay curious and never underestimate your own ability to make a positive impact on the world. Even if it's in small ways, it all adds up."),
("Monica", "And remember, this conversation doesn't end here."),
("Monica", "Keep asking those questions, keep those minds sharp, and we'll be back soon with another deep dive into the fascinating world around us. Until then, stay curious."),

("Tharun", "That's the kind of the radical idea that we are going to be unpacking today as we dive into the sentient protocol.")
("Monica", "Exactly. Imagine a world where like anyone with the skills can build AI.")
("Tharun", "Right.")
("Monica", "So you're interested in open AI.")
("Tharun", "Absolutely.")
("Monica", "And this white paper. It really tackles a big question. Okay. How do we make sure that all these brilliant minds out there  get rewarded for their work? Yeah. Even in like an open system, right?")
("Tharun", "Right.")
("Monica", "Because right now, Yeah. It's like a few, a few big players Kind of hold most of the cards when it comes to AI development.")
("Tharun", "Yeah, right. It's like a gold rush, but only a few companies are the ones that get to actually stake their claim.")
("Monica", "Exactly.")
("Tharun", "So I'm guessing the sentient protocol is like trying to change that?")
("Monica", "Exactly. Imagine a world where like anyone with the skills can build AI.")
("Monica", "Okay.")
("Monica", "Own their creations and even like earn from them.")
("Tharun", "Wow. It's about democratizing AI development, making it like a collaborative effort rather than, you know, this closed off club.")
("Monica", "Okay, so instead of us just like downloading the latest app, we could be downloading, tweaking, even like creating the, the almost like building blocks of intelligence itself. Yeah.")
("Tharun", "That's, that's, that's huge. But how do you even begin to untangle ownership in that kind of free for all?")
("Monica", "Right. So that's where the OML format comes in. And this is where the white paper gets really, really clever.")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "So OML stands for Open Monetizable")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "And loyal.")
("Tharun", "Oh.")
("Monica", "It's like a, like a stamp of approval that tells you, this AI model, it's accessible, you can track its use, so you can reward the creators.")
("Tharun", "Uh huh.")

("Tharun", "So it's like a seal of quality and trust. Kind of like, like Fairtrade coffee, but for AI.")
("Monica", "Exactly. It brings ethics and fairness into the equation.")
("Tharun", "I love it.")
("Monica", "Now the white paper, it dives into several different ways to actually make this OML format a reality.")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "One idea is obfuscation.")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "Picture, like, Scrambling a secret recipe. Okay. Like, all the ingredients are there, but good luck baking that cake without the code to unscramble the")

("Monica", "Right. Clever. But someone could crack the code, right?")

("Monica", "Okay.")
("Tharun", "It's like hiding a secret message within the very fabric of the AI.")
("Monica", "Oh, wow. So, even if someone copies the model, you can always trace it back to its, like, origin?")

("Tharun", "Oh, boy.")

("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "Right? And then there's the power of cryptography.")
("Tharun", "Right.")
("Monica", "Using complex encryption to protect the model.")
("Tharun", "Oh, wow.")
("Monica", "Okay, so we've got our secret recipe, we've got our invisible ink, and we've got our high security vault.  It sounds like they're pulling out all the stops to try to make this, this OML format actually work.")
("Tharun", "They are.")
("Monica", "But each of these methods must come with, like, its own challenges.")

("Monica", "Yeah.")
("Tharun", "While it's great for security, someone with enough time and resources.")
("Monica", "Mm hmm.")
("Tharun", "potentially crack the code, you know?")
("Monica", "It's a bit like an escape room, right? Right. Like, the more complex the puzzle is, the more satisfying it is to actually solve it.")
("Tharun", "Right.")
("Monica", "What about fingerprinting?")
("Tharun", "Sure.")
("Monica", "What are the potential drawbacks there?")
("Tharun", "Well, one challenge is, um,  Like striking a balance.")
("Monica", "Okay.")
("Tharun", "You need to insert enough of these fingerprints to make them effective, but not so many that they actually degrade the AI's performance.")
("Monica", "Okay.")
("Tharun", "So it's a delicate dance.")
("Monica", "So you don't want to weigh down the AI with too much security that it can't actually function optimally.")
("Tharun", "Exactly. Right. Yeah.")
("Monica", "It's like trying to hide a treasure chest. You want to bury it deep, but not so deep that you can't find it yourself.")
("Tharun", "Right. Exactly. And then there's the issue of what they call adversarial hosts.")
("Monica", "Okay.")
("Tharun", "These are people who are actively trying to circumvent those fingerprints.")
("Monica", "Oh, wow.")
("Tharun", "Right. They might, they might, Tweet the model's code or find ways to, like, prompt the AI in a way that bypasses the fingerprint responses.")
("Monica", "So it's a constant, like, cat and mouse game between those trying to protect the AI and those who are trying to exploit it.")
("Tharun", "Exactly.")
("Monica", "That's where things get really, really interesting.")
("Tharun", "I'm dying to know, like, how they tackle these challenges.")
("Monica", "Well, one solution they propose for fingerprinting is, uh, it's downright fascinating. Okay. They call it the coalition attack conundrum.")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "And it involves techniques inspired by something called search with liars.")
("Tharun", "Okay, now you've piqued my curiosity.")
("Monica", "What on earth is search with liars? And how does it apply to AI fingerprinting?")
("Tharun", "Hold on to your hats because we're about to get into the really ingenious stuff.")
("Monica", "Okay, so search with liars, AI fingerprinting. Like, walk me through this. Like, I'm about to star in a, like a tech thriller.")
("Tharun", "All right, so picture this.")
("Monica", "Someone gets their hands on, like, multiple fingerprinted AI models.")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "And they try to, like, blend them together. Okay. Hoping to, you know, erase those individual fingerprints. Oh. It's like a, it's like trying to create, like, a generic brand of cereal by mixing a bunch of name brand ones together.")
("Tharun", "A recipe for a very bland AI, I imagine.")
("Monica", "But you're saying the white paper has a way to, like, Tell those generic brands apart.")
("Tharun", "Exactly. So, search with liars. It's all about extracting truth from unreliable sources.")
("Monica", "Oh, wow. Right? It's like,")
("Tharun", "uh, it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but some of the hay is telling you it's a needle, too.")
("Monica", "Oh, wow.")
("Tharun", "So, the white paper suggests we apply similar techniques to AI fingerprinting.")
("Monica", "Okay.")
("Tharun", "They propose, like, scattering these fingerprints strategically.")
("Monica", "Okay.")
("Tharun", "Across multiple models.")
("Monica", "So, even if someone tries to blend those models together.")
("Tharun", "Right.")
("Monica", "You can still, like Analyze the, the output.")
("Tharun", "Exactly.")
("Monica", "And use those strategically placed fingerprints to be like, aha, I know which models were used.")
("Tharun", "Like a, like a cryptographic detective, like piecing together the evidence.")
("Monica", "That's a great way to put it. And, you know, the more fingerprints you add, the harder it becomes to like, to hide those, those borrowed models.")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "It's all about making the system incredibly resilient to these kinds of attacks.")
("Tharun", "It's like, it's like building a security system where like the more locks you add, the harder it is to break in. Right. And speaking of security, we've talked a lot about the OML format, but what about the sentient protocol itself? Like, how does, how does it all come together?")
("Monica", "So the white paper, it lays out a four layer system to make this vision of, like, this community driven AI a reality.")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "Think of it as the infrastructure for, like, a whole new AI ecosystem. Okay,")
("Tharun", "so if the OML format is, like,  What are, what are the layers that make up this, this high tech fortress?")
("Monica", "So first up you have what they call the storage layer.")
("Tharun", "Imagine")
("Monica", "a secure tamper proof vault where")
("Tharun", "all")
("Monica", "these AI models and all their different versions are stored.")
("Tharun", "They propose Using blockchain technology for this.")
("Monica", "Blockchain, the ultimate digital record keeper. So it's like a public library for AI. Exactly. Where every book is like permanently catalogued.")
("Tharun", "Exactly. Transparency and security are paramount here. I")
("Monica", "love it.")
("Tharun", "Next, you have what they call the distribution layer.")
("Monica", "This is where those models are converted into that, that traceable OML format.")
("Tharun", "Okay, so this is where they get fitted with those invisible fingerprints wrapped in cryptographic code, or tucked away in those, those secure hardware vaults.")
("Monica", "Precisely. This layer also, like, It ensures clear ownership, it handles any disputes, and it makes sure the right people get paid when their model is used.")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "It's all about fairness and transparency.")
("Tharun", "It's like a combination of, like, a patent office and a royalty collection agency, but Like for, for the AI world.")
("Monica", "Exactly. What")
("Tharun", "about access to these models?")
("Monica", "That's where the, uh, access layer comes in.")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "This layer acts as the gatekeeper. Right. Granting permission to use the models.")
("Tharun", "Uh huh.")
("Monica", "Meticulously tracking usage.")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "And ensuring that those creators receive their, you know, their due rewards.")
("Tharun", "So it's like, it's like a subscription service, but for AI models. Yeah,")
("Monica", "you can think of it that way. You")
("Tharun", "subscribe to the models you need and the creators get paid based on your usage.")
("Monica", "Exactly. But")
("Tharun", "what's to stop someone from just like trying to bypass this layer and just  get access to it that they're not authorized to have?")
("Monica", "The white paper, they address that too. They propose using what they call watchers. Okay. Which are essentially like digital guardians.")
("Tharun", "Okay.")
("Monica", "That monitor for any unauthorized use.")
("Tharun", "Okay. It's about maintaining the integrity of the system.")
("Monica", "It's like having AI security guards like patrolling the digital perimeter.")
("Tharun", "Yeah.")
("Monica", "So, we've got our secure storage. Right. We've got our fair distribution. Yeah. We've got controlled access. What's the final piece of the puzzle? Ah,")
("Tharun", "the incentive layer.")
("Monica", "Okay.")
("Tharun", "And this is where it ends. All comes together beautifully.")
("Monica", "Okay.")
("Tharun", "This layer, it, like, it crunches all the usage data.")
("Monica", "Okay.")
("Tharun", "It determines how much each contributor deserves.")
("Monica", "Mm.")
("Tharun", "Based on, you know, their ownership stake. Right. And then it, you know, that distributes those rewards.")
("Monica", "Mm. So it's like the economic engine of the entire system.")
("Tharun", "Yes. Ensuring that everyone has a reason to, like, contribute to this community driven AI future.")
("Monica", "Precisely. The white paper really emphasizes that the sentient protocol, it's not just about, like, building technology. Yeah. It's about building a more, you know, Equitable and accessible future for AI development.")
("Tharun", "It's about making sure that the, like the benefits of AI are, are shared widely, not just concentrated in the hands of like, you know, a few powerful entities. Exactly. That's a vision worth striving for. But with all this talk of like technical solutions, right? I can't help but wonder about like the, the human element.")
("Monica", "Sure. What about the social and ethical considerations of a world where AI is truly open and accessible?")
("Tharun", "That's, that's a crucial question and you're right, we can't, like, we can't just focus on the technical aspects here. We need to think deeply about  the implications of this technology. Right. You know, both positive and, you know, potentially negative.")
("Monica", "It's like we're, we're standing on the edge of, like, uncharted territory.")
("Tharun", "Yeah. Right. Yeah.")
("Monica", "The possibilities are exciting.")
("Tharun", "Yeah.")
("Monica", "But we need to proceed with, like, caution and awareness.")
("Tharun", "Absolutely. And the white paper does acknowledge that there's still a lot to figure out, especially when it comes to, um, what they call the loyalty aspect of OML.")
("Monica", "What do they mean by loyalty in this context?")
("Tharun", "So it's about ensuring that AI models are used for, like, their intended purposes.")
("Monica", "Okay.")
("Tharun", "And not modified in ways that could be, you know, harmful or unethical.")
("Monica", "Okay. Think of it as building in, like, safeguards to prevent the AI equivalent of, like, fake news. Oh, wow.")
("Tharun", "Or worse. Right. Yeah. Like, really, really bad stuff.")
("Monica", "So it's not just about preventing, like, unauthorized use, it's, it's about preventing misuse.")
("Tharun", "Exactly. Even by people who are authorized users.")
("Monica", "Right. That adds a whole other layer of complexity.")
("Tharun", "It does. And as you can imagine, it's a challenge that raises a lot of questions.")
("Monica", "Yeah. Like, who gets to define what constitutes harmful or unethical use? Right. How do you build in these safeguards? Without, you know, stifling innovation or limiting the potential benefits of, you know, of open AI.")
("Tharun", "These are questions that go, like, way beyond the technical realm and delve into the very core of, like, our values as, as a society.")
("Monica", "Exactly. It seems like the sentient protocol, while incredibly promising, is just the first step on a much, much longer journey. For sure. A journey that will require, like, careful consideration.")
("Tharun", "Open dialogue and a willingness to like adapt as we learn more about the, the potential and the pitfalls of this, of this powerful technology.")
("Monica", "Absolutely. It's almost like we're, we're handing someone this toolbox full of like incredibly powerful tools. Right. But we also need to give them  a compass to make sure those tools are actually used to build something good.")
("Tharun", "Yes. Right. Yeah.")
("Monica", "And it feels like the sentient protocol is really trying to  strike that balance.")
("Tharun", "Yes. Absolutely.")
("Monica", "It is, and this idea of loyalty actually ties into one of the white paper's like most ambitious goals, OML 1. 0. Okay. They envision it as like a stepping stone. Okay. Towards a future where AI is truly decentralized. Okay. And secure. Where those tools and that compass are, like, built into the very fabric of the technology itself.")
("Tharun", "So, OML 1. 0 is, like, the, the prototype.")
("Monica", "Yeah, you could think of it that way. For")
("Tharun", "this whole new way of, not just developing AI, but interacting with AI.")
("Monica", "Exactly. Right? Right. What are, what are, like, the, the biggest hurdles they still need to overcome? Sure. To make that vision a reality?")
("Tharun", "Well, they highlight a few key challenges.")
("Monica", "Okay. Scaling up the number of fingerprints without, you know, impacting the AI model's performance, that's a big one. Right. It's like trying to make a cake rise with a ton of extra ingredients. Right. You just have to be really careful not to throw off the balance.")
("Tharun", "Yeah. Finding that sweet spot between security and functionality, right?")
("Monica", "Exactly. Yeah. What else?")
("Tharun", "Well, they also talk about the need for even more, um, Sophisticated and resilient fingerprinting techniques. Okay. Remember those adversarial hosts we talked about? Yeah. The people trying to, like, circumvent the system.")
("Monica", "Right. As")
("Tharun", "AI gets more advanced. Yeah. Those trying to, like, gain this system are going to get more advanced as well.")
("Monica", "Right. It's, it's like an arms race of innovation with each side trying to like outsmart the other. Exactly.")
("Tharun", "Right. And it")
("Monica", "makes you realize that, that the sentient protocol, this isn't just like a, a static solution. Right. Yeah. This needs to constantly be evolving. It")
("Tharun", "does. Stay ahead of like, you know, ahead of the curve.")
("Monica", "Absolutely. And that evolution, it needs to involve more than just like, you know, technical improvements. Okay. Yeah. We")
("Tharun", "need to have like these open and honest conversations")
("Monica", "about")
("Tharun", "the ethical implications of this technology. Right. About the values we want to embed into it. Right. And about the, the safeguards we need to put in place to prevent its misuse.")
("Monica", "It's like, we're not just building a new technology, we're, we're building a new society alongside it.")
("Tharun", "Yes. And that requires like careful thought, collaboration. Yes. And, and a healthy dose of humility.")
("Monica", "Couldn't have said it better myself. Right.")
("Tharun", "And that, my friend, is the beauty of, you know, a deep dive like this. Yeah.")
("Monica", "You know, we've journeyed from the intricacies of, you know,  AI cryptography. Oh, right.")
("Tharun", "To these profound questions about the future of intelligence itself. It's amazing. Yeah. We've explored the technical nuts and bolts. Right. But we've also, like, grappled with these, these ethical dilemmas. Yes. Right. And, and the societal implications of a future that's, that's being shaped by open AI.")
("Monica", "Exactly. Right.")
("Tharun", "And we've only just scratched the surface. We")
("Monica", "have, we have. Right. Yeah.")
("Tharun", "What I find so fascinating about this white paper is that it doesn't just present a white  Right. Right. It invites us to ask, like, even bigger, more challenging questions.")
("Monica", "It's a call to action. Yeah. For developers, policy makers, and really, like, all of us, you know. Right. To really think critically and, and engage thoughtfully with these incredible possibilities. Yeah. But also the very real risks of, of this AI revolution.")
("Tharun", "It's a reminder that the future of AI, this isn't something that's just gonna like happen to us.")
("Monica", "Right. This is something that we are actively creating. We are. Each and every day. Every day. Through the choices we make and the conversations that we have.")
("Tharun", "So true. So true. And on that note, we'll leave you with this final thought.")
("Monica", "Yes.")
("Tharun", "As AI becomes more powerful and more pervasive,")
("Monica", "Right.")
("Tharun", "what role do you want to play in shaping its development and its impact on the world?")
("Monica", "It's a question worth pondering.")
("Tharun", "It is a question worth pondering. Until")
("Monica", "next time.")
("Tharun", "Until next time, keep exploring, keep questioning, and keep diving deep.")
